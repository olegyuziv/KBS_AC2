Effective management of a building's climate includes maintaining optimal temperature and air
quality alongside ensuring energy efficiency. Beyond climate control, the smart building system
must promptly detect and signal alarms for security and infrastructure issues. Our goal is to
develop an expert system that integrates these functions, offering precise control and fast
responses. This integration aims to create a comfortable and secure environment while
optimizing energy usage and mitigating potential risks.
The rules defined by the building automation specialists for our expert system are as follows:
Artificial light is switched on in a room when:
- The building is open for the specified day and hour
- The room is occupied
- There is no natural light in room at the specified hour
Ventilation is activated in a room when:
- The building is open for the specified day and hour
- The room is occupied
- The room does not have windows or the weather is not mild
Air conditioning is activated in a room when:
- The building is open for the specified day and hour
- The room is occupied
- The weather is hot
- Room temperature is above 27 degrees Celsius
Heating is activated in a room when:
- The building is open for the specified day and hour
- The room is occupied
- The weather is cold
- Room temperature is below 19 degrees Celsius
There is natural light in a room when:
- It is morning (hour is between 9 and 16)
- The room has at least one window
A building is open when:
- It is workday (day is between Monday and Friday)
- It is work time (hour is between 8 and 20)
Floor alarm is triggered when:
- The building is not open
- There is a window open in any of the rooms
Building alarm is triggered when:
- The building is not open
- There is any room that it is occupied
It is considered:
• Mild weather when the temperature is greater than 17C and less than 31C.
• Cold weather when the temperature is less than or equal to 17C.
• Hot weather when the temperature is greater than or equal to 31C.
Input: Feel free to choose the format of the input to the program. For example: hardcoded string
or list of strings, JSON file, txt file, user input (probably impractical for testing purposes).
